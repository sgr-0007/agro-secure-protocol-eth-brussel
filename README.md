## Overview

Agro Secure Protocol is a blockchain-based insurance solution for farmers, designed to provide secure, transparent, and efficient insurance services. Utilizing World ID for proof of human-ness, Chainlink for data integration, and advanced risk assessment models, the protocol ensures fair premium calculations and reliable claim processing.

## Features

- **World ID Integration**: Ensures user authenticity.
- **Chainlink Oracles**: Provides reliable data from external sources.
- **Risk Assessment**: Advanced algorithms for accurate risk calculation.
- **Decentralized Claims Verification**: Multi-party authorization for claims processing.

## Architecture

### World ID Verification

- **Biometric Verification**: Uses ZKSnark for privacy-preserving identity proof.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Ensures unique identity through robust verification mechanisms.

### Chainlink Integration

- **Data Fetching**: Collects location and crop data from Web2 APIs.
- **Data Provision**: Feeds reliable data to the Risk Factor Calculation module.

### Risk Factor Calculation

- **Data Analysis**: Assesses weather, yield, and pest risks.
- **Composite Risk Score**: Generates a comprehensive risk score for premium calculation.

### Premium Calculation

- **Premium Formula**: Calculates premiums based on the composite risk score.

### Claims Processing

- **Decentralized Verification**: Claims must be authorized by five parties.
- **Staking and Rewards**: Authorized parties stake coins and receive a percentage of the insured amount upon claim approval.
